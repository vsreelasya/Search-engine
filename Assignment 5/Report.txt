In Assignment 5 
I have taken the already preprocessed files from the Assignment4 and i have opened the input files in read mode 
After that i have caluclated the term frequency of each term in particular document i.e count{} where key and value are stored as word and frequency

I have created a dictionary of dictionary and have appended the document like a word is key and the value will be a dictionary that has dictionary name and the value of that dictionary will b term frequency
Now if we caluclate the length of the outer dictionary it is the document frequency of that value.
So i have given in the output that it is Word and Document frequency and Document name and a Term frequency
You can email me if you have any doubts
