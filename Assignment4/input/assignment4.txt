Assignment #4
Due Date: Oct 13, 2016

*************************************************************************
Remember: Assignments must be turned in electronically (via email to the TA). 
In case of a programming assignment, you must be careful about what to 
turn in. If some parts of the assignment are too large, e.g. the output, 
then you only need to print your assignment report and source code. Each 
assignment must have a cover page with your name, assignment number, and due
date. Also, please include the statements of all the problems. A
report which summarizes your solution and results, in the form of a MS
Word document or equivalent, must accompany an assignment submission.

Any questions? Contact Dr. Vasile Rus at vrus@memphis.edu or by phone
at 678-5259.

Problem 1 [30 points]. Write a Perl program that preprocesses a 
collection of documents using the recommendations given in the 
Text Operations lecture. The input to the program will be a directory
containing a list of text files. Use the files from assignment #3 as
test data as well as 10 documents (manually) collected from news.yahoo.com . 
The yahoo documents must be converted to text before using them.

Remove the following during the preprocessing:
- digits
- punctuation
- stop words (use the generic list available at ...ir-websearch/papers/english.stopwords.txt)
- urls and other html-like strings
- uppercases
- morphological variations
