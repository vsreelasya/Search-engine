Due Date: Sept 01, 2016

*************************************************************************
Remember: Assignments must be turned in electronically (via email). 
In case of a programming assignment, you must be careful about what 
to turn in. If some parts of the assignment are too large, e.g. the output, 
then you only need to print your assignment report and source code. 
Each assignment must have a cover page with your name, assignment number, 
and due date. Also, please include the statements of all the problems. A
report which summarizes your solution and results, in the form of a MS
Word document or equivalent, must accompany an assignment submission.

Any questions? Contact Dr. Vasile Rus at vrus@memphis.edu or by phone
at 678-5259.
