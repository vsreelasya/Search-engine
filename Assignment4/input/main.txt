    08/23/16 Welcome to the Information Retrieval and Web Search course.

Welcome! The Information Retrieval and Web Search course addresses one of the major problem of our times. Today, one of the major problems is not lack of information but too much information. We need intelligent ways to organize the vast amount of information available at our fingertips and to effectively search for what we want. We are faced with an Information Overload problem. The Information Retrieval and Web Search class presents the major challenges posed by this problem and solutions to these challenges. The course introduces computational techniques to search for information in static collections of documents and in dynamic collections, e.g. web. Students will be exposed to text processing algorithms, classical information retrieval models (e.g., Boolean and Vectorial models), and web search techniques. The course is closely related to the Natural Language Processing course.

Course catalog entry: Advanced current research topics in database and information management, with emphasis on nontraditional data and applications. PREREQUISITE: COMP 7116 or permission of instructor.

Assignments: In general, you get 50% of the grade for correctness and robustness and 50% for quality of the solution, documentation and style. Assignments should be written clearly and if code is required the code shoud follow at least the Recommended standard below.

Code Style Standard 	Recommended

Plagiarism/Cheating Policy: Plagiarism or cheating behavior in any form is unethical and detrimental to proper education and will not be tolerated. All work submitted by student (projects, programming assignments, lab assignments, quizzes, tests etc.) is expected to be a student's own work. The plagiarism is incurred when any part of anybody else's work is passed as your own (no proper credit is listed to the sources in your own work) so the reader is led to believe it is therefore your own effort. Students are allowed and encouraged to discuss with each other and look up resources in the literature (including the internet) on their assignments, but appropriate references must be included for the materials consulted, and appropriate citations made when the material is taken verbatim.

If plagiarism or cheating occurs, the student will receive a failing grade on the assignment and (at the instructor discretion) a failing grade in the course.The course instructor may also decide to forward the incident on to University Judicial Affairs Office for further disciplinary action.

Tentative Schedule

You may find lectures and assignments here! Lectures are compiled from different sources including personal notes, textbooks, materials used in related classes on Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing at famous universities (primarily from UT Austin - Dr. Ray Mooney and UNT - Dr. Rada Mihalcea) and other materials.
