A flood of news has broken this week about Donald Trump: a 2005 videotape surfaced, forgotten quotes were unearthed, and women have stepped forward alleging sexual assault. Watching it all unfold on social media with the rest of us was one woman who had a front row seat to Trump’s antics: Miss Teen USA 2010, Kamie Crawford.

“I wanna spill my tea so bad,” Crawford tweeted after retweeting quotes from a BuzzFeed story alleging that Trump had walked into the dressing rooms of pageant contestants as young as age 15. “But let me just say – I believe every word,” Crawford wrote. After some encouragement from her followers, she pressed on, sharing what she alleged happened when she encountered Trump years ago.

Crawford describes the pageant as an interesting experience. According to her account on Twitter, at just 17 years old, Crawford was warned about Trump. “I was forewarned prior to meeting him that, ‘Mr. Trump doesn’t like black people so don’t take it the wrong way if he isn’t extremely welcoming towards you. If he is, then u just might be the ‘type’ of black he likes,’” she tweeted. It was startling advice for the new titleholder.


According to Crawford, who declined Yahoo’s requests for an interview and seems to be declining all interview requests per her Twitter account, this was her only personal experience with racism.

And if she doubted the advice, it wasn’t long before she says she saw it up close and personal. “Sure enough after I was warned about him, I saw him in action&witnessed him completely snub a black contestant at Miss Universe rehearsals,” the model and cast member of BET’s F in Fabulous tweeted. “While she was practicing on stage. Literally turned his back to the stage and made a face like he was going to vomit at the sight of her.” Crawford does allow that the action could have been initiated by something else.



This news is one of a few admissions from those who have had interactions with Trump that they say fall into the racist category. Kwame Jackson, a former contestant on The Apprentice, told Salon he believed the presidential candidate to be “at his core, racist.” In fact, a producer for the first two seasons of the show alluded to there being “far worse” tapes of Trump than the now infamous Access Hollywood footage published by the Washington Post last Friday, with one source saying that the tapes could include racist language.

In 1973, the Justice Department sued Trump Management for anti-black bias, charging both Donald Trump and his father, Fred Trump, with discrimination against black people in the way they operated apartment rentals they owned. Trump, who was 27 years old at the time, called the allegations “completely ridiculous,” saying “we never have discriminated, and we never would.”

Trump’s separation from the Miss Universe Organization came after a racially fueled dispute. Both NBC and Univision refused to air the Miss USA pageant after Trump made controversial comments implying that Mexican immigrants are rapists when he announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. Trump then sold the Miss Universe Organization, which includes the Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA pageants to WME/IMG in September 2015.

In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, sources who worked closely with Trump when he owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants claim he demonstrated a bias against women of color. According to the article, one source recalled that he did not want African-Americans in the top 10 of the Miss USA pageant. This person also said: “He was very concerned one year. He did not want one woman to win because she was Puerto Rican. He said, ‘She can’t win. Don’t get me wrong she’s a beautiful girl, I just don’t want her to win.’”

That said, a source close to the pageant, who asked to remain anonymous, tells Yahoo Beauty that she has never heard any comments about racism relative to Trump. During his ownership of the Miss Universe Organization from 1996 to 2015, the source notes that the organization “moved away from crowning the typical ‘pageant Barbie’ and moved toward crowning Latina, and somewhat later, multi-ethnic or racially ambiguous contestants.”

According to the source, Crawford “loves to be the center of attention.”

We also reached out to a number of participants in the 2010 Miss Teen USA pageant, and spoke with former Miss Teen Alabama Ashlyn Alogi, who is white.

“Based on my own experiences, as well as general consensus from the other state winners of 2010, Mr. Trump did NOT make the described ‘barfing’ gesture, I would have known about it if he had,” Alogi said via email. “It is disappointing for individuals to make claims so offensive and untrue. I hold people to a higher societal standard than lying out of misplaced enmity and political allegiances.”

Crawford, though, says she was the “type” of black woman Trump reportedly likes. “He toted me around his buddies who were all there gawking at the Miss Universe girls,” she tweeted. “Bragged about how ‘beautiful’ and ‘well spoken’ I was. ‘She’s so smart, look how smart she is,’ he kept saying. Mind u, baby boy just met me.”

The Trump campaign has not responded to Yahoo Beauty’s request for comment.

Donald Trump Is Apparently Suing the *New York Times*, Which Will Go Horribly For Him

Just hours after the New York Times published the detailed, utterly harrowing accounts of two women who claim they were groped by Donald Trump, the famously litigious alleged serial predator had his lawyers working through the night to make good on his longstanding empty threat to sue the Times. This letter is a master class in nonsensical, meaningless legalese, and Times executive editor Dean Baquet can and should use it as a placemat next time he orders takeout to his office. From the looks of the letter, it looks like Trump will allege that the Times' story is libelous. Libel does not mean that Trump can sue whenever a newspaper prints something about him that he doesn't like. ...

Donald Trump is reportedly gearing up for 'all-out war' against female accusers, media

At least four women came forward on Wednesday to accuse Donald Trump of unwanted sexual groping or kissing — two spoke with The New York Times, one to the Palm Beach Post, and the fourth wrote a first-person account in People — and the Trump campaign early Thursday threatened to sue The New York Times for defamation and libel. Trump personally denied the accounts in The Times and his spokespeople called the other two false. On MSNBC Wednesday night, Rachel Maddow ran through some of the accusations, then turned to Washington Post political reporter Robert Costa to find out how the Trump team is reacting to the growing trickle of sex-assault accusations. "Donald Trump is in Miami tonight, near Doral, his property, but his campaign, I would describe it as all-out war against the accusers and especially against the media organizations that are running the stories," Costa said. ...

    While Andrew Frye lay dying on the floor of a Super 8 motel room in Green, Ohio, in April, a party raged around him. The attendees - high from a mixture of heroin and fentanyl - weren’t other teenagers but the 16-year-old’s mother and grandmother, police said. Prosecutors would later say the very people who should have protected the teenager from the dangers of drug use were the ones who walked him to a ledge and “enabled” him to jump. “We have evidence of drug abuse by more than one person, more than one relative of the deceased,” Summit County Sheriff Steve Barry told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in April. “It appears his mother, her friend and his grandmother, and a friend of the grandmother,

This Is What Happens If You Don't Shower for Two Days

Having a shower is a daily routine for most of us, but if you've ever been tempted to skip your body-washing session when you're rushed for time one morning, you might want to think again. According to an article published by TwentyTwoWords, there are a number of pretty gross things that happen to your body when you skip showering for two days straight. The first problem comes down to bacteria. Humans carry around 1,000 types of bacteria around with them, including 40 types of fungus, reports the website. While most of these are actually good for us, it needs help fighting off the bad bacteria from soap. "You can't contain the bad bacteria if you don't shower," the site explains. "And if they

Jerusalem Holy Site Declared Muslim, Not Jewish

One of the world's most important religious sites and Judaism’s holiest site, Jerusalem’s Temple Mount and Western Wall, were reclassified as an exclusively Muslim shrine Thursday after a United Nations organization adopted a polarizing resolution that denies Jewish connection to the site. The resolution, which condemns Israel for its activities in Jerusalem and the West Bank, asserts that Jerusalem is holy to three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity. However, it includes a special section pertaining to the Temple Mount that says the site is sacred only to Muslims and fails to mention it as sacred to Jews.

A professor at the City University of New York's Brooklyn College reports he was asked to change a class syllabus by school administrators worried a participation grade could be misunderstood as a request for sexual favors. Prof. David Seidemann wrote at Minding the Campus, a higher ed watchdog site, that his syllabus included a notice that grading would consider "Class deportment, effort etc……. 10% (applied only to select students when appropriate)." In an email to Reason about the resulting reprimand, Seidemann said his department chair told him that statement "could be construed as a prelude to sexual harassment" and should be immediately excised.

    Mother, boyfriend locked boy in closet, beating and torturing him over two years, Chicago authorities say

    It was a dreary Sunday morning on Chicago’s South Side when someone spotted the boy. Wearing only a soiled pullup diaper, he was seen running against southbound traffic on Lake Shore Drive, a busy eight-lane thoroughfare that hugs the coast of Lake Michigan. A passer-by called 911 to report the alarming sight. When police arrived, they found a 7-year-old covered in cuts and bruises, malnourished and bleeding from a fresh gash above his left eye. A doctor who examined the boy would later say he had never seen so many injuries on a human being, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. As the boy was being treated at the hospital, police found the person that prosecutors now say is responsible for his

Among the items mentioned in the nearly hour-long conference call: - Admissions for comparable Cup events was up about 1 percent compared to the same time last year. This was mostly attributed to the Daytona race in July. In 2015, the seating capacity was reduced to about 50,000 for the Daytona summer race as construction continued on the grandstand. The stadium debuted at this year’s Daytona 500 with 101,500 seats. - Watkins Glen had a second consecutive sellout this year. - Michigan International Speedway saw admission declines for both its Sprint Cup events.

    iPhone 8’s most revolutionary rumored feature probably isn’t happening

    A few weeks ago, Brian Roemmele penned widely circulated post on Quora articulating a number of reasons why Apple's next-gen iPhone, a device likely to be called the iPhone 8, will be made out of "stunning ceramic." While specifically touting the mechanical strength and toughness of zirconium ceramics , Roemmele simultaneously relied upon a number of loosely connected patent filings from Apple to further justify his rather bold prediction. "Zirconia ceramics exhibits the highest mechanical strength and toughness at room temperature," Roemmele explained. "Zirconium ceramics have the highest fracture toughness of any advanced technical ceramic. Its toughness, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance make it ideal for high pressure applications." DON'T MISS:  New report suggests the mysterious new Apple product we told you about is the real deal On the surface, Roemmele's explanation is certainly compelling, especially since the last three iterations of the iPhone all, more or less, look and feel the same. That said, the idea of a new iPhone model made out of a completely novel and advanced material with space-age characteristics understandably got the Apple masses excited. For anyone out there who got excited about Apple's iPhone 8 being made out of ceramics, well, it's time to jump back to reality. In fact, you can probably bet good money that the iPhone 8 will assuredly not be made out of zirconia ceramics. Earlier this week, product designer Greg Koenig of Atomic Delights  penned an incredibly detailed and straight-forward post explaining why the iPhone 8 will likely be made out of familiar materials. In short, any grand visions of a ceramic iPhone will have to be put on hold. Based on the manufacturing process Apple utilizes to produce the white ceramic Apple Watch -- as detailed in a booklet included within the wearable's packaging -- Koenig explains that it would be highly impractical if not downright foolish to assume that Apple could scale this same process over to the iPhone without anyone noticing. The process they describe is meticulously executed, and because of the nature of the design - wherein ceramics are mimicking the engineering layout of far more easily produced materials - probably the most laboriously produced ceramic watch on the market. In fact, if we scale the numbers used in the booklet up to iPhone size devices and cycle times, Apple would need 2 football field's worth of kiln space for each ceramic iPhone to sinter for the requisite 36 hours. For the 2 hours of hard ceramic machining to finish the case details, Apple would need to go from 20,000 CNC machines, to 250,000. They would need another 200,000 employees to perform the 2 hours of hand polishing to "bring out the strength and luster." More bluntly, not only is Apple not using any new ceramics manufacturing technology in the new Watch Edition, they are not even utilizing the primary patent the original Quora article pins most of it's extrapolations on - that patent described a vacuum liquid slurry casting process for ceramics. The Edition watch uses a very common pressed powder forming method. Additionally, the logistics involved in acquiring the requisite machinery in sufficient volume to mass produce tens of millions of ceramic iPhones would seemingly preclude the plan from getting off the ground in time for the iPhone 8. "To do this," Koenig writes, "Apple would need to essentially flip the switch on an investment of roughly the same size of the current, machining footprint. Not only would this be a logistical nightmare, but finding a company to produce that much machinery without 3-4 years of lead time would be almost impossible." With Apple reportedly "manufacturing roughly 1 million iPhones per day" during peak production times, it's important to remember that any new process or material Apple wants to incorporate into the iPhone has to be able to scale. All told, you should definitely read Koenig's full explanation, especially if you're the least bit interested in the advanced manufacturing processes and logistical considerations that go into mass producing a device as popular and widely distributed as the iPhone.
