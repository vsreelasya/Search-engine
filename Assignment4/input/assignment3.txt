Assignment #3
Due Date: Sept 22, 2016

*************************************************************************
Remember: Assignments must be turned electronically (via email to the TA). 
In case of a programming assignment, you must be careful about what to 
turn in. If some parts of the assignment are too large, e.g. the output,
then you only need to print your assignment report and source code. Each 
assignment must have a cover page with your name, assignment number, and due
date. Also, please include the statements of all the problems. A
report which summarizes your solution and results, in the form of a MS
Word document or equivalent, must accompany an assignment submission.

Any questions? Contact Dr. Vasile Rus at vrus@memphis.edu or by phone
at 678-5259.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem 1 [20 points]. Design an extension of the basic Boolean model that 
would allow for ranking of the retrieved documents. Be as detailed as possible.

Problem 2 [30 points]. Write a Perl script that displays the vocabulary
and frequency of each word in the main page of the class' website and
on all other documents directly linked from the main page. For each
word, also compute in how many different documents it occurs in this
small collection. You must use hashes.
