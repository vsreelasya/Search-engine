Advanced current research topi
cs in database and information management, with emphasis on 
nontraditional data and applications. PREREQUISITE: COMP 7116 or permission of 
instructor. 
Why this course?
Today, one of t
he major problem
s
is not lack of information but too mu
ch informatio
n. We 
need 
intelligent  ways  to  organize  the  vast  amount  of  information  available  at  our  fingertips  and  to 
effectively  search  for  what  we
want
.  W
e  are  faced  with an  Informatio
n Overload  problem. The 
Information Retrieval and Web Search 
class presents the ma
jor challenges 
posed by this problem 
and solutions to 
these challe
n
ges
.
The 
course 
introduces  computational  techniques
to  search  for  information  in  static  collections 
of  documents  and 
in  dynamic  collections,  e.g. 
the 
web.  Students  will  be  exposed  to  text
processing
algorithms
,  classical  information
retrieval  models  (e.g., 
Boolean  and  Vectorial 
models
)
,  and  web  search  techniques.
The  course  is  closely  related  to  the  Natural  Language 
Processing course.

Students are req
uired to make a presentation as part
of the Homework 
grade
. The 
presentation consists of power point slides presented in front of the class for

minutes and 
an accompanied report of 3

is  for  90
-
91, A for  scores  ranging from
92 to
97, anything above 
98
leads to A+
