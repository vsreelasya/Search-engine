Down Ticket #20: The ten most — and least — principled Republican responses to Trump

At this point, pretty much every Republican candidate in the country has been forced to take some sort of stand on Donald Trump. After the leak last Friday of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” tape showing Trump bragging to host Billy Bush that he can “grab” women “by the p****” simply because he’s “a star,” at least 15 leading GOP figures — including Arizona Sen. John McCain, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, and Nevada Senate candidate Joe Heck, all of whom will be on the ballot this fall — either withdrew their earlier endorsements or said they could no longer in good conscience vote for the Republican nominee. Another 40 or so went further, calling for Trump to step aside and let someone else take his place atop the ticket.

Why are so many Trump accusers suddenly coming forward now?

If all these women were violated by Donald Trump years ago, why are they just speaking up now? “If I had been sexually harassed by this man, the Megyn Kelly story would have given me an opportunity,” Scarborough said. Trump surrogate A.J. Delgado had already suggested the same on All in with Chris Hayes the night before, saying “These allegations are decades old.

NYT lawyer mocks Trump lawsuit threat: ‘We welcome the opportunity to have a court set him straight’

Donald Trump arrives to speak at a campaign rally in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Thursday. The New York Times is standing by its story about two women who say Donald Trump kissed or groped them without consent, and rejected the GOP nominee’s accusation that it had committed libel. David McCraw, the vice president and assistant general counsel for the Times, wrote a letter Thursday to Trump attorney Marc Kasowitz saying the paper would not remove the article in question from its website or issue an immediate retraction and apology.

Giuliani rails against press for publishing new Trump sexual misconduct allegations: ‘They are liars!’

Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and one of Donald Trump’s top advisers, aimed a fiery rebuke at members of the media Thursday for publishing multiple allegations of unwanted sexual advances lodged by women against the Republican presidential nominee. “They are liars!” Giuliani said in West Palm Beach, Fla., while warming up the crowd at a rally for the embattled GOP candidate. Giuliani railed against the New York Times — which he referred to as the “Clinton Campaign Newsletter” — after the newspaper published a report detailing claims by two more women who say Trump groped them without their consent.

Michelle Obama aims blistering speech at Donald Trump: ‘No woman deserves to be treated this way’

An impassioned Michelle Obama delivered a blistering indictment against Donald Trump at a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in Manchester, N.H., Thursday. “The fact is that, in this election we have a candidate for president of the United States who, over the course of his lifetime and over the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are so shocking, so demeaning, I simply will not repeat anything here today,” she said. Obama took Trump to task for his divisive rhetoric during her speech at the Democratic National Convention in July, and again for his propagation of the so-called birther conspiracy while campaigning for Clinton in Virginia last month — each time refraining from using his name.

When should private emails become the public’s business?

    When should private emails become the public’s business?

    In 1972, a group of burglars working for the Republican Party broke into Democratic headquarters in the dead of night, searching for documents that might influence that year’s presidential election. Reporters from the Washington Post spent years unraveling the scandal, until at last it brought down the president who had concealed it. Forty-four years later, a group of criminals, quite possibly working in concert with operatives from the Russian government, broke into the correspondence of Democratic campaign aides and began releasing troves of personal emails, in hopes of influencing this year’s presidential election.
