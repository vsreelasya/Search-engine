‘Family Feud’ Contestant’s Unbelievable Score in ‘Fast Money’ Round

“Family Feud” contestant Kai got an unbelievably high score as the first to play “Fast Money” for the Trimble family. All the clues came from a survey of 100 married men, and Kai, a woman, answered four of the five categories with the No. 1 answer to score 194 of the necessary 200 to win the game. The crowd, along with Kai’s family, went crazy when they saw the score, but Kai barely cracked a smile. In fact, she appeared to turn to host Steve Harvey and say, “I told you so.”

When Kai’s teammate came out, Harvey asked if she’d prefer to know how many points she needed or how many points Kai got. She wanted to know how many she needed and couldn’t believe it when harvey told her.

“Are you kidding me?!” she exclaimed as the crowd again cheered loudly.

With only six points needed to win, she understandably seemed a bit overconfident, but when it came time to answer the questions, she had almost identical answers to Kai’s. Only the first answer was different. She’d answered nine while Kai had answered eight. On the other four answers, she got the buzzer and passed, and never got the chance to answer again. So with six points needed, it all came down to her first answer. Harvey knew it would be harder than she thought.

“You said every single thing she said. That’s why I knew it was gonna be tough,” Harvey said.

The Trimble family needed six of the 100 married men surveyed to have answered “Nine” on the first Fast Money question to win. The board turned and showed a 9. The 194 points that Kai got was unbelievable, and barely enough.

    She wanted to be the ‘fun weekend mom.’ Now, her teenage son is dead and she’s going to prison.

    While Andrew Frye lay dying on the floor of a Super 8 motel room in Green, Ohio, in April, a party raged around him. The attendees - high from a mixture of heroin and fentanyl - weren’t other teenagers but the 16-year-old’s mother and grandmother, police said. Prosecutors would later say the very people who should have protected the teenager from the dangers of drug use were the ones who walked him to a ledge and “enabled” him to jump. “We have evidence of drug abuse by more than one person, more than one relative of the deceased,” Summit County Sheriff Steve Barry told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in April. “It appears his mother, her friend and his grandmother, and a friend of the grandmother,

This Is What Happens If You Don't Shower for Two Days

Having a shower is a daily routine for most of us, but if you've ever been tempted to skip your body-washing session when you're rushed for time one morning, you might want to think again. According to an article published by TwentyTwoWords, there are a number of pretty gross things that happen to your body when you skip showering for two days straight. The first problem comes down to bacteria. Humans carry around 1,000 types of bacteria around with them, including 40 types of fungus, reports the website. While most of these are actually good for us, it needs help fighting off the bad bacteria from soap. "You can't contain the bad bacteria if you don't shower," the site explains. "And if they

Jerusalem Holy Site Declared Muslim, Not Jewish

One of the world's most important religious sites and Judaism’s holiest site, Jerusalem’s Temple Mount and Western Wall, were reclassified as an exclusively Muslim shrine Thursday after a United Nations organization adopted a polarizing resolution that denies Jewish connection to the site. The resolution, which condemns Israel for its activities in Jerusalem and the West Bank, asserts that Jerusalem is holy to three monotheistic religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity. However, it includes a special section pertaining to the Temple Mount that says the site is sacred only to Muslims and fails to mention it as sacred to Jews.

A professor made 'effort' worth 10 percent of students' grades. The school said that's sexual harassment.

A professor at the City University of New York's Brooklyn College reports he was asked to change a class syllabus by school administrators worried a participation grade could be misunderstood as a request for sexual favors. Prof. David Seidemann wrote at Minding the Campus, a higher ed watchdog site, that his syllabus included a notice that grading would consider "Class deportment, effort etc……. 10% (applied only to select students when appropriate)." In an email to Reason about the resulting reprimand, Seidemann said his department chair told him that statement "could be construed as a prelude to sexual harassment" and should be immediately excised. The administrator also said Seidemann must

    Mother, boyfriend locked boy in closet, beating and torturing him over two years, Chicago authorities say

    It was a dreary Sunday morning on Chicago’s South Side when someone spotted the boy. Wearing only a soiled pullup diaper, he was seen running against southbound traffic on Lake Shore Drive, a busy eight-lane thoroughfare that hugs the coast of Lake Michigan. A passer-by called 911 to report the alarming sight. When police arrived, they found a 7-year-old covered in cuts and bruises, malnourished and bleeding from a fresh gash above his left eye. A doctor who examined the boy would later say he had never seen so many injuries on a human being, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. As the boy was being treated at the hospital, police found the person that prosecutors now say is responsible for his

We are polite and respectful to her during social gatherings - birthdays, weddings, holidays - but we decided it is in the best interest of our family to plan no more interaction than necessary. My husband checks in with her via phone or text throughout the week.

    ISC issues third quarter report, discusses attendance for Sprint Cup events

    International Speedway Corp. held its conference call with investor analysts Thursday morning to detail results from the third quarter. Among the items mentioned in the nearly hour-long conference call: - Admissions for comparable Cup events was up about 1 percent compared to the same time last year. This was mostly attributed to the Daytona race in July. In 2015, the seating capacity was reduced to about 50,000 for the Daytona summer race as construction continued on the grandstand. The stadium debuted at this year’s Daytona 500 with 101,500 seats. - Watkins Glen had a second consecutive sellout this year. - Michigan International Speedway saw admission declines for both its Sprint Cup events.

    iPhone 8’s most revolutionary rumored feature probably isn’t happening

    A few weeks ago, Brian Roemmele penned widely circulated post on Quora articulating a number of reasons why Apple's next-gen iPhone, a device likely to be called the iPhone 8, will be made out of "stunning ceramic." While specifically touting the mechanical strength and toughness of zirconium ceramics , Roemmele simultaneously relied upon a number of loosely connected patent filings from Apple to further justify his rather bold prediction. "Zirconia ceramics exhibits the highest mechanical strength and toughness at room temperature," Roemmele explained. "Zirconium ceramics have the highest fracture toughness of any advanced technical ceramic. Its toughness, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance make it ideal for high pressure applications." DON'T MISS:  New report suggests the mysterious new Apple product we told you about is the real deal On the surface, Roemmele's explanation is certainly compelling, especially since the last three iterations of the iPhone all, more or less, look and feel the same. That said, the idea of a new iPhone model made out of a completely novel and advanced material with space-age characteristics understandably got the Apple masses excited. For anyone out there who got excited about Apple's iPhone 8 being made out of ceramics, well, it's time to jump back to reality. In fact, you can probably bet good money that the iPhone 8 will assuredly not be made out of zirconia ceramics. Earlier this week, product designer Greg Koenig of Atomic Delights  penned an incredibly detailed and straight-forward post explaining why the iPhone 8 will likely be made out of familiar materials. In short, any grand visions of a ceramic iPhone will have to be put on hold. Based on the manufacturing process Apple utilizes to produce the white ceramic Apple Watch -- as detailed in a booklet included within the wearable's packaging -- Koenig explains that it would be highly impractical if not downright foolish to assume that Apple could scale this same process over to the iPhone without anyone noticing. The process they describe is meticulously executed, and because of the nature of the design - wherein ceramics are mimicking the engineering layout of far more easily produced materials - probably the most laboriously produced ceramic watch on the market. In fact, if we scale the numbers used in the booklet up to iPhone size devices and cycle times, Apple would need 2 football field's worth of kiln space for each ceramic iPhone to sinter for the requisite 36 hours. For the 2 hours of hard ceramic machining to finish the case details, Apple would need to go from 20,000 CNC machines, to 250,000. They would need another 200,000 employees to perform the 2 hours of hand polishing to "bring out the strength and luster." More bluntly, not only is Apple not using any new ceramics manufacturing technology in the new Watch Edition, they are not even utilizing the primary patent the original Quora article pins most of it's extrapolations on - that patent described a vacuum liquid slurry casting process for ceramics. The Edition watch uses a very common pressed powder forming method. Additionally, the logistics involved in acquiring the requisite machinery in sufficient volume to mass produce tens of millions of ceramic iPhones would seemingly preclude the plan from getting off the ground in time for the iPhone 8. "To do this," Koenig writes, "Apple would need to essentially flip the switch on an investment of roughly the same size of the current, machining footprint. Not only would this be a logistical nightmare, but finding a company to produce that much machinery without 3-4 years of lead time would be almost impossible." With Apple reportedly "manufacturing roughly 1 million iPhones per day" during peak production times, it's important to remember that any new process or material Apple wants to incorporate into the iPhone has to be able to scale. All told, you should definitely read Koenig's full explanation, especially if you're the least bit interested in the advanced manufacturing processes and logistical considerations that go into mass producing a device as popular and widely distributed as the iPhone.
